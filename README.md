#Guide to contributing

We want as many people as possible to contribute to this site. Thus, we've layed out some steps to the various ways in which you can contribute to the site. Please note that we will review all contributions to make sure that the information is appropriate, informative, and substantive. We may ask for clarification or further explanation for edits and answers. 

#####  Interview questions/answer

1) Add an interview question:
-    First, go into main.py and scroll down to the function interview_question_section_main. Find your question category and add the question title to the question list. The question title should be descriptive, short, can contain spaces, and should be formated with title capitalization. 
-    Second, go templates/questions and find the directory that marks your question category (Strings-and-Arrays, Graphs, etc). Navigate into the correct category and create your question html page. This page should be named exactly what you named your question in main, except insert dashes (-) where spaces were in your question title. 
-    If you would like to answer the interview question as well as add it, scroll down for information.

2) Add an interview answer:
-   Too add an interview answer, navigate to templates/questions and choose the directory that matches the category of the question you'd like to answer. Then, edit the html document for your question. 

3) Add advice to freshman/sophomores/juniors/seniors:
-   Simply submit a pull request with the edits to the appropriate html document.
